      <p> I began creating 3D art in the form of dreamscapes at the end of 2020. I needed a mental escape from the chaos that was going on in the outside world while COVID-19 disrupted
        our normal lives. I discovered Blender 3D, the software I use to create these surreal landscapes, and dove right in. 
        I posted on social media every day, and the response was positive, eventually leading to posts on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKNpR7-j5s9/?igsh=MjY3MnI0OW8yem5h">Hypebae</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRCLXg1HzAn/?hl=en&img_index=1">Stelinspo</a> social media and an article feature by <a href="https://visualatelier8.com/interview-sage-sarvie-architectural-surrealism/">Visual Atelier 8</a>.
       I eventually gained traction in-person as well, and was featured in two separate exhibitions at the <a href="https://www.seattlenftmuseum.com/">Seattle NFT Museum</a>: "Pioneering Women" and "Cultural Kaleidoscope", and at exhibition Forest For The Trees (FFTT) in Seattle.

      <p>I was later discovered by <a href="https://www.wild.xyz/sage-sarvie">WildXYZ</a>, an NFT startup focused on bringing the most creative minds to the forefront of digital art.
      I worked with their developers to create a series of 100 unique immersive spaces available for purchase as non-fungible tokens. 
      These spaces were created initially in Blender 3D, then exported to Unreal Engine 5 and made completely interactive on browser. 
      I ensured to keep the pieces engaging by adding "easter egg" elements such as the ability to fast-forward time in the scene, change from day to night, and be seated in the conversation pit or pool.
      The series was almost completely sold out, with 97/100 pieces being purchased within the first few weeks of release. </p>

      <p>I expanded on my work and remained engaged with users by creating a Google Chrome extension, <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sage%20tab/pfckpcnpnbaigkjoieemmkhcnegkkajc?hl=en">Sage Tab</a>.
      See beautiful dreamscapes each time a new tab is opened. I coded and deployed this extension myself and showcase pieces that I created. </p>
